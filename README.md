Devastating tests

This is a terrible change, with terrible guidance, written by a terrible person.  It's terribly confusing, and should never have been committed.

This is the worst commit that has ever been.  Who let this guy be a developer on this project?!  This is bad, and he should feel bad.

This shouldn't get committed yet
